# My-Projects 
This is a complete project about COVID-19 data and prediction of cases or deaths from this pandemic using machine learning models
such as polynomial regression, support vector regression or neural networks such as facebook's Prophet or LSTMs, GRUs, with addition of Attention mechanisms. 
For starters we visualize the data and then we use the aforementioned models to predict the outbreak of the pandemic.

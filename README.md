# Covid-19 Project
## About the project 
This is a complete project about COVID-19 data visualization and prediction.
For data visualization we use clasic tools like pie-cSharts, heat-tables, graphs but also geographic heatmaps. 
For the prediction purposes, we focalise in cases and deaths caused from the pandemic and we use regression models
such as polynomial regression, support vector regression or ARIMA but also other forecasting methods such as 
Meta's Prophet. Machine/Deep learning models (neural networks) like LSTMs, GRUs, with Attention mechanisms are also deployed. 

The project is divided into two sub-parts: 1) The pre-processing, visualization and classical ways of prediction the pandemic and 2) The prediction and experimentation with neural networks. 
For more information you can read the Thesis short description [here](./Thesis_Description_English.pdf). Additionally, as the whole project was carried out in Googgle Colab, it is _highly recommended_ to run everything in Colab.

### Part 1: Pre-processing & Data Visualization & Classical Prediction.

__STEP 1__: Clone the repository by using: 
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/arpajj/Covid-19-Project.git
```
Then upload and store everything (all files) in your Google Drive.

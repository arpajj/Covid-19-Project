# Covid-19 Project
## About the project 
This is a complete project about COVID-19 data visualization and prediction.
For data visualization we use clasic tools like pie-charts, heat-tables, graphs but also geographic heatmaps. 
For the prediction purposes, we focalise in cases and deaths caused from the pandemic and we use regression models
such as polynomial regression, support vector regression or ARIMA but also other forecasting methods such as 
Meta's Prophet. Machine/Deep learning models (neural networks) like LSTMs, GRUs, with Attention mechanisms are also deployed. 

The project is divided in two three sub-parts: 1) The pre-processing and visualization, 2) The maps and classical prediction and 3) The neural networks. 

### Part 1: Pre-processing & Data Visualization.
For starters we visualize the data and then we use the aforementioned models to predict the outbreak of the pandemic.

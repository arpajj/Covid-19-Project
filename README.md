# My-Projects 
This is a complete project about COVID-19 data and prediction of cases or deaths from this pandemic using regression models
such as polynomial regression, support vector regression or ARIMA and machine learning models (neural networks) such as 
facebook's Prophet or LSTMs, GRUs, with addition of Attention mechanisms. 
For starters we visualize the data and then we use the aforementioned models to predict the outbreak of the pandemic.
